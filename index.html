      <p>My name is Eric Hubbard and most of the intro is already known to most of my classmates. This is third semester working towards an online degree in Information Technology. This class is another part of the required courses for the degree program, but I enjoy these CMPS classes over the NSET or Business Law. The large amount of business courses are some of the drawbacks to this particular degree program.  The technology degree courses involving server or database administration are closer my work and personal interests. I have worked in the information technology for several large companies in various infrastructure supervising and/or support roles. I am most comfortable with Windows operating systems, but can use Solaris, OS X, RedHat and Ubuntu. I am excited to gain a better understanding  of new technologies in the industry I adore daily. I hope to gain a better understand of programming structure from this class. I have always copied other scripts, and trying to bend it to fit my needs. I hope to better develop my own style and understanding in this class. I look forward to working with the class, and wish all us the best of luck. </p>
